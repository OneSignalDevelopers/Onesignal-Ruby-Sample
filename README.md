# onesignal-ruby-sample

This example project demonstrates how to get started sending push notifications using the [OneSignal Ruby API client](https://rubygems.org/gems/onesignal). You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## Running this sample

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created. If you don't have one made already, you'll need to [create one](https://app.onesignal.com/apps/new) before starting (follow our [Web Push Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-1-choose-integration) for guidance on a configuring OneSignal for a web).

1. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, then set `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` to your OneSignal app ID and `ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY` to your app's REST API key.
2. Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
3. Execute the script, `ruby app.rb`

Note that you will need to have a OneSignal app created with at least one device subscribed to Push before this example will work. Check the [Web Push Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-1-choose-integration) for guidance on a OneSignal app.
